 1: 6
 2: cout << a_list[0] << " " << a_list[5] << endl;
 3: 48, 40, 5, 320, 40
 4: Valid. The value at a_list[4] ('U') is copied into a_list[0]
 5: Invalid. nums is an array of integers not an integer itself
 6: Invalid. This will compile but will produce a segfault as you are accessing out of bounds data, which will be garbage.
 7: Valid. i/2 becomes 1 since both operands are integers, so the value at a_list[1] (4.6) is copied into a_list[4]
 8: Valid. 28 will be copied in to nums[9]
 9: Valid. The decimal equivalent of the character at vowels[0] (65) is stored in nums[5]
10: Valid. The value of a_list[i] is multiplied by 2 and becomes 14
11: Invalid. The index of an array must be an integer.
